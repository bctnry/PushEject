# PushEject
The nhentai downloader revisited.

## The History
I once, or twice should I say, have written scripts for downloading doujins
from nhentai for the simple reason that I hate manually right-clicking on
every pics. First time I've used PHP, the second time bash with curl. The
first one have lost in an OS re-installation; I still have the latter one
sitting in my hard drive, but that one was rather primitive. Thought it's
time to rewrite.

As for the name, the script itself didn't have such a name in the beginning;
I thought of it on my way back to the capsule hotel I'm currently living.
I was listening to Boom Boom Satellite's Push Eject.
