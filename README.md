# PushEject
The nhentai downloader revisited.

## The history
I once, or twice should I say, have written scripts for downloading doujins
from nhentai for the simple reason that I hate manually right-clicking on
every pics. First time I've used PHP, the second time bash with curl. The
first one have been lost in an OS re-installation; I still have the latter
one sitting in my hard drive, but that one was rather primitive. Thought it's
time to rewrite.

As for the name, the script itself didn't have such a name in the beginning;
I thought of it on my way back to the capsule hotel I rented back in Aug. 2018.
I was listening to Boom Boom Satellite's Push Eject.

## Does writing code actually help you relax?
That kinda depends. It of course wouldn't be as relaxing as coding in a top-tier
mansion with your girlfriend hugging you from the back if you live in a capsule
hotel.

## How long are you gonna stay in Shenzhen?
**UPDATE 2019.1.16**: I'm in Shenzhen now. Again. This time maybe a *lot* longer.

At least till 7th September. To be fair, I hate Shenzhen. I hate it with a
passion. Shenzhen is a city built in just 30 years, and it's there just
because it's next to Hong Kong, which (in my opinion) makes it lack of
something that's critical for being a big city. It's generally expectant
in an annoying way, and also (in my opinion) generally unfriendly towards
outsider, even if Shenzhen is basically made up of no one but outsiders.
It's bad in a way just like Python: it's good sometimes, but in all of other
times it's literal shit.

## Are you gonna support Windows/Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/OpenIndiana/etc...
That actually depends on what language I would use. I decided to use python
because till now I have been working with python for three whole months,
(unfortunately) making python the language I'm most familiar with.

## Any recommendation on doujins?
Haha. Even if you know I'm not gonna recommend any. <del>Sayori's and kikurage's
are good though.</del>
